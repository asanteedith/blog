		<h2>How a Blank Page Turned Into My First Line Of Code</h2>
			</div>
<hr>
		<div class="middle">
        
<p class="paragraph">I remember the first time I stared at an empty code editor.
		It felt like standing in front of a blank canvas—exciting but also
			terrifying. I wasn't sure where to start or if I even
			 belonged in this space.
		I was a nurse first not a developer.But something about the logic
		 the problem-solving, the building—it called
			to me. My journey into web development didn't start with a fancy 
			bootcamp or a tech degree.
		It started with curiosity. I wanted to understand how websites worked
			how buttons knew what to do, and how information moved behind the scenes
			So I Googled. A lot. Broke things. A lot more. But with every broken line
			of code
			I learned something new.Today I'm not just clicking around websites—I am
			building them.
			Every line of code I write solves a real problem. Every project I touch
			helps someone do something better.
			And this blog? It's my way of sharing what I'm learning along the way—the
			wins,the bugs, the late nights, and the quiet victories.
			If you've ever felt like you don't quite belong in tech, I've been there.
		    But trust me—there's space for your story too.</p>
